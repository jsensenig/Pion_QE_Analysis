### Display plots in HTML

This script will take the plots in the ROOT file generated by the 
analysis code and display it in a browser. 

Dependencies:

* `Python 3.8`
* `Flask 1.1.2`
* `ROOT 6.22`

The server can be started with
```
python main_page.py <path_to_root_file>
```
Then open a web browser window at `localhost port 5000` to view the plots using
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
To update the plots simply refresh the window.
